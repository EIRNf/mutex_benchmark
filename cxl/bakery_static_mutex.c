// Note: restructuring absolutely needed because mutex->choosing doesn't work -- it needs emucxl_write instead.

// TODO: does this code get ruined by endianness? the buffer stuff seems like it might be.
// TODO: storing num_threads locally as part of the pointer (fat pointer) would be better; it doesn't change.

// Should be constant, but the API doesn't allow it.
